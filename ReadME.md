# StyleSUP

styleSUP is a CSS Component library created purely based on HTML and CSS. The inspiration for ideas are taken from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/);

## Get Started

To use any of the components within this library, 2 files are required as follows:
1. Add the external CSS on the respective HTML page.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet"
href="https://stylesup.netlify.app/styles/components.css">
```
2. Add the JavaScript for certain components which needs an action and outcome.
```HTML
<script type="text/javascript"
src="https://stylesup.netlify.app/scripts/script.js">
</script>
```
> Note: Add the JavaScript code snippet just before the `</body>` such that all the components work well.
